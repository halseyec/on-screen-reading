1. Use the overlays created in Camera Control to create a solid background (rather than transparent background which is all that is supported by the mainboard ID titling right now).

2. PTZ information (azimuth, elevation, compass direction) is displayable but does not support a timeout if wanting to use the solid background labels (e.g. the overlay labels where we can change the color/etc).

3. Preset name is displayable but does not support a timeout if wanting to use the solid background labels, same as case 2 above.

4. Overlay text location is user defined on x and y axes for overlay labels that support the solid background.
